#Visual Basic Vending Machine

This is my final project for Intro to Programming: Visual Basic

  A vending machine that allows a user to make up to 5 selections, add money, recieve change and their items. The machine allows for up to 20 orders per day. There is also a manager mode with a log-in page. Manager mode allows a manager to add inventory and remove the days profit. They can also generate and print a sales report and an inventory report.
